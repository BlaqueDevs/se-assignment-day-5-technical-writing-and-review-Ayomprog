To effectively communicate technical information visually, choose visuals that match the type of data and the message you want to convey: use bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends over time, diagrams for processes, and scatter plots for relationships between variables. 

## 9. How do headings and subheadings improve the readability and organization of technical documents?
